## Frequently Asked Questions

**What’s a Criterium race?** A criterium is a mass start, multi-lap event contested on a closed course where laps are typically a mile or less and include 4-6 corners. Racers do a pre-determined number of laps or race for a pre-determined amount of time. The Juniors race will last 20 min.
