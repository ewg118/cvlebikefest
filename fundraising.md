## About the Fundraiser


<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-8">
	Our aim is not only to bring a series of high-quality bike races to Charlottesville (the first of their kind in 30 years), but also fundraise for the local non-profit bicycle shop, <a href="https://www.charlottesvillecommunitybikes.org/">Charlottesville Community Bikes</a>. Charlottesville Community Bikes (CCB) promotes environmentally-sound transportation, recycles bicycles, and makes biking accessible to the local community. CCB believes equitable access to affordable, reliable bike transportation can be transformative to people in need. They operate 5 core programs:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Free Kids' Bike Program</strong>: CCB provides free refurbished bikes to kids 12 and under (over 1,000 bikes given away in 2020-2021!)</li>
		<li><strong>Bike Referral Program</strong>: In partnership with over 20 local nonprofits, CCB provides free refurbished bikes (plus helmets, lights, and locks) for adults in need (over 350 bikes given away in 2020-2021!)</li>
		<li><strong>Mobile Repair Clinics</strong>: CCB holds free bike repair clinics at community events in underserved neighborhoods and communities in Charlottesville and Albemarle County.</li>
		<li><strong>Educational Programming</strong>: CCB teaches bike safety and repair skills to customers of all ages, empowering community members to repair and maintain their own bicycles. They conduct bike repair training classes for volunteers and community members.</li>
		<li><strong>Refurbished Bike and Repair Shop</strong>: CCB refurbishes and sells bikes to provide the community with affordable, environmentally sound transportation (over 800 bikes refurbished and sold in 2020-2021!).</li>
	</ul>

In Summer 2021, CCB piloted a biking program for middle schoolers at the Boys and Girls Club, and they plan to expand their youth riding programs in 2022. This fundraiser will go towards helping CCB expand their youth programming.

Racers from out of town can also make a huge difference by bringing bicycles or components (both new and used). Community Bikes is always looking for donations, both large and small, of materials they can repurpose to broaden access to cycling among the local community. They'll accept anything ranging from fully-intact bikes to bike frames and smaller parts like tubes, tires, and chains.
