	<p>The <a href="https://cvilleracing.com">Charlottesville Racing Club</a> and UVA Cycling Club are proud to announce the inaugural CVLEBIKEFEST presented by <a href="https://dairymarketcville.com/">The Dairy Market</a> on Saturday, April 16 from 10 AM to 4 PM! The day long fest will be a series of Criterium races, a kids race and a bike parade. The aim of the Fest is to not only bring a series of high-quality bike races to Charlottesville (the first of their kind in 30 years), but also fundraise for the local non-profit bicycle shop, <a href="https://www.charlottesvillecommunitybikes.org/">Charlottesville Community Bikes (CCB)</a>. CCB promotes environmentally-sound transportation, recycles bicycles, and makes biking accessible to the local community and believes equitable access to affordable, reliable bike transportation can be transformative to people in need. This fundraiser will go towards helping CCB expand their youth programming. You can make a difference by donating <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/charlottesville-criterium">here</a>.</p>

### Family Fun
This be will a fun event for the family. The city has graciously allowed us to close off Preston ave. and the portion of Grady directly in front of Dairy Market. We have ample space to watch racers whiz by on the course, we have partnered with the Dairy Market, who have all sorts of food and beverage vendors who will be participating in the event. See below for more info on food and beverage options.

**There will be a Juniors race**: The race is Criterium for ages 9-18 at 10am that lasts 20 minutes. There are two steps involved and both MUST be done BEFORE race day: 1) Obtain USA Cycling membership (free for Juniors!). Please see [https://usacycling.org/juniors/](https://usacycling.org/juniors/) for further information. 2) Sign up for Event here: [https://www.bikereg.com/charlottesville-criterium](https://www.bikereg.com/charlottesville-criterium).

**There will be a kids race**: For children 8 and under, we will host a kids race on a segment of the course (~200meters total distance). Have your kids bring their bike (and decorate them advance for extra fun) and their helmets so they can participate. Sign up will be on race day at the registration table (in front of the Dairy Market) and must be complete before 11:30am. Helmets are required!

**There will be a bike parade**: Directly after the noon Dash Race for children 8 and under, anyone (young or old) is welcome to join in the bike parade to ride 2 or 3 laps around on the closed course at a slow "Party Pace." This is not a race! Any type of bicycle is welcome, including e-bikes, but helmets are required for all cyclists!
