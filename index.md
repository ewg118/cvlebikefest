	<p>The Charlottesville Racing Club and UVA Cycling Club are proud to announce the inaugural CVLEBIKEFEST presented by <a href="https://dairymarketcville.com/">The Dairy Market</a> on Saturday, April 16 from 10 AM to 4 PM! The day long fest will be a series of Criterium races, a kids race and a bike parade. The aim of the Fest is to not only bring a series of high-quality bike races to Charlottesville (the first of their kind in 30 years), but also fundraise for the local non-profit bicycle shop, <a href="https://www.charlottesvillecommunitybikes.org/">Charlottesville Community Bikes (CCB)</a>. CCB promotes environmentally-sound transportation, recycles bicycles, and makes biking accessible to the local community and believes equitable access to affordable, reliable bike transportation can be transformative to people in need. This fundraiser will go towards helping CCB expand their youth programming. You can make a difference by donating <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/charlottesville-criterium">here</a>.</p>
	<p>CRC is also pleased to also offer a raffle to support the financing of this event. Courtesy of our sponsor <a href="https://www.wintergreenresort.com/">Wintergreen Resort</a>, we are able to offer two equal prizes of 1 night in the hotel at Wintergreen + 2 lift tickets. You can purchase tickets <a href="https://go.rallyup.com/charlottesville-criterium-pb-thedairymarket/Campaign/Details">here</a>!</p>
