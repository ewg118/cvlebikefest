	<p>The Charlottesville Racing Club and UVA Cycling Club are proud to announce the second annual CVLEBIKEFEST presented by <a href="https://dairymarketcville.com/">The Dairy Market</a> on Saturday, April 29, 2023 from 10 AM to 4 PM! The day long fest will be a series of Criterium races and a noon bike parade. The aim of the Fest is to not only bring a series of high-quality bike races to Charlottesville, but also fundraise for the local non-profit bicycle shop, <a href="https://www.charlottesvillecommunitybikes.org/">Charlottesville Community Bikes (CCB)</a>. CCB promotes environmentally-sound transportation, recycles bicycles, and makes biking accessible to the local community and believes equitable access to affordable, reliable bike transportation can be transformative to people in need. This fundraiser will go towards helping CCB expand their youth programming. You can make a difference by donating <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/charlottesville-criterium">here</a>.</p>

### Course 
This is a fun, 6 corner course near downtown Charlottesville. There is one uphill kicker halfway through the course with a chicane at the top; and the finishing straight is on a wide 3% uphill drag. There are definitely attack points on this course with the opportunity to make the race exciting!

The course has been mapped out on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/routes/2916879606499550452).
